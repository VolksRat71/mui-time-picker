# TODO: NPM Distribution Checklist

This checklist will guide you through the process of distributing your MUI Time Picker package on NPM.

## Pre-Distribution Setup

### 1. Complete Development Tasks
- [x] Enhance component with all time units (Years, Weeks, Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds, Milliseconds)
- [x] Add configurable digit options (1-3 digits for Years, Days, Milliseconds)
- [x] Set up build configuration with Rollup
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation (README.md)
- [ ] Add TypeScript definitions (.d.ts files) - optional but recommended
- [ ] Create example/demo usage
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests

### 2. Package Configuration
- [x] Set up package.json with correct metadata
- [x] Configure build scripts (npm run build)
- [x] Set up linting (npm run lint)
- [ ] Configure testing (npm run test)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) - optional

### 3. Quality Assurance
- [ ] Run all tests and ensure they pass
- [ ] Build the package locally (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Test the built package in a separate project
- [ ] Lint the codebase (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities (`npm audit`)

## NPM Account & Repository Setup

### 4. NPM Account Setup
- [ ] Create an NPM account at https://www.npmjs.com/signup
- [ ] Verify your email address
- [ ] Set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for security
- [ ] Log in to NPM from command line: `npm login`

### 5. Repository Setup
- [ ] Create a GitHub repository for your package
- [ ] Update package.json with correct repository URLs
- [ ] Add a proper LICENSE file (MIT recommended)
- [ ] Push your code to GitHub
- [ ] Create releases/tags for versions

### 6. Package Name & Availability
- [ ] Check if "mui-time-picker" is available: `npm view mui-time-picker`
- [ ] If taken, choose an alternative name (consider scoped packages like @yourusername/mui-time-picker)
- [ ] Update package.json name field if needed
- [ ] Reserve the package name: `npm publish --dry-run`

## Testing & Validation

### 7. Local Testing
- [ ] Test build process: `npm run build`
- [ ] Check dist folder contents
- [ ] Create a test project to import and use your component
- [ ] Test with different MUI versions
- [ ] Test on different React versions (17, 18)

### 8. Package Validation
- [ ] Run `npm pack` to create a tarball
- [ ] Extract and inspect the tarball contents
- [ ] Ensure only necessary files are included (check .npmignore or package.json files field)
- [ ] Check bundle size is reasonable
- [ ] Test installation from tarball: `npm install ./mui-time-picker-1.0.0.tgz`

## Documentation & Examples

### 9. Documentation Completeness
- [x] Complete README.md with installation, usage, and examples
- [ ] Add CHANGELOG.md for version history
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section
- [ ] Include contribution guidelines

### 10. Example Projects
- [ ] Create a simple example project
- [ ] Add CodeSandbox or StackBlitz demo links
- [ ] Document common use cases
- [ ] Test examples work with fresh NPM installation

## Publishing Process

### 11. Version Management
- [ ] Choose initial version (recommend starting with 0.1.0 or 1.0.0)
- [ ] Update package.json version
- [ ] Create git tag: `git tag v1.0.0`
- [ ] Push tags: `git push --tags`

### 12. Dry Run Publishing
- [ ] Run `npm publish --dry-run` to test publishing process
- [ ] Review what files will be published
- [ ] Fix any issues found during dry run

### 13. First Publication
- [ ] Run `npm publish` to publish to NPM
- [ ] Verify package appears on NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mui-time-picker
- [ ] Test installation from NPM: `npm install mui-time-picker`
- [ ] Create GitHub release with release notes

## Post-Publication

### 14. Verification & Testing
- [ ] Install package in a fresh project
- [ ] Test all documented examples work
- [ ] Check package appears correctly on NPM website
- [ ] Test TypeScript definitions work (if provided)

### 15. Promotion & Documentation
- [ ] Update README with NPM badge
- [ ] Share on social media, Reddit, dev communities
- [ ] Submit to awesome lists (awesome-react-components)
- [ ] Consider writing a blog post about your component

### 16. Maintenance Setup
- [ ] Set up issue templates on GitHub
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines
- [ ] Set up automated testing (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Plan for future updates and maintenance

## Future Enhancements

### 17. Potential Improvements
- [ ] Add TypeScript support with full type definitions
- [ ] Create Storybook documentation
- [ ] Add more themes and customization options
- [ ] Support for internationalization (i18n)
- [ ] Add animation and transition effects
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, screen reader support)
- [ ] Mobile-specific optimizations

### 18. Version Updates
- [ ] Plan semantic versioning strategy
- [ ] Set up automated changelog generation
- [ ] Create update notification system
- [ ] Plan deprecation strategy for old versions

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Publishing Issues
- **403 Forbidden**: Check if package name is available or if you have permissions
- **Package size too large**: Review included files, add .npmignore
- **Build fails**: Check all dependencies are in package.json
- **Tests fail**: Ensure all tests pass before publishing

### Post-Publication Issues
- **Installation fails**: Check peer dependencies are correctly specified
- **Import errors**: Verify main/module fields in package.json
- **TypeScript errors**: Ensure .d.ts files are included and correct
- **Runtime errors**: Test in different environments and React versions

## Notes
- Remember to increment version numbers for each publish
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Always test thoroughly before publishing
- Consider using `npm publish --tag beta` for pre-release versions
- Keep good documentation and examples up to date

Good luck with your NPM package! ðŸš€
